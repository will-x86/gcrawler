# Custom crawler


The idea is that you can use custom parts for almost all of the crawler.


Say you want to use this application, but you want to use a proxy? 

Well you can, just implement the crawl interface, and it'll work :) 

This also works for custom "Enqueue links", e.g. the LinkPolicies provided don't work for you.
